# Data Cleansing

This project aims to explore and understand the data first before fixing the anomalies within it. The dataset used for this is a food delivery data of a restaurant in Melbourne, Australia.

The datasets:

<ul>
  <li> <b>dirty_data.csv</b> : carries rows with at most one anomaly in it.</li>
  <li> <b>missing_data.csv</b> : contains rows with one or more missing values.</li>
  <li> <b>outlier_data.csv</b> : contains data with outliers in them.</li>
</ul>

<b> Dijkstra's algorithm </b> is used to calculate the shortest distance between a customer and the restaurant.
