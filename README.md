# Data Cleansing

This project aims to explore and understand the data to identify potential anamolies. After which, the anamolies are resolved using suitable imputation methods. 

<b>Datasets:</b>

Food delivery data of a restaurant in Melbourne, Australia.

<ul>
  <li> <b>dirty_data.csv</b> : carries rows with at most one anomaly in it.</li>
  <li> <b>missing_data.csv</b> : contains rows with one or more missing values.</li>
  <li> <b>outlier_data.csv</b> : contains data with outliers in them.</li>
</ul>

<b> Dijkstra's algorithm </b> is used to calculate the shortest distance between a customer and the restaurant.
